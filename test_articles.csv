How to Take a Screenshot on a Windows PC: 8 Simple Tricks,"Go to the screen that you want to capture. When you screenshot your entire screen, everything that's open will be captured in your screenshot. Be sure to close any windows you don't want open.
This method will quickly capture everything on your screen and save the image to your PC. Once you've saved the screenshot, you can edit it or share it with anyone. Find the ⎙ Print Screen key on your keyboard. The Print Screen key is most often found in the upper-right side of the keyboard, not counting the numeric keypad. 
The Print Screen key will usually be abbreviated to ""PrtSc"" or something similar. Take your screenshot. You have two options for capturing your entire screen: 


Instantly save the screenshot as an image: Press the Windows key and the PrtSc keys at the same time. This saves your screenshot as a PNG file to the Screenshots folder in your Pictures folder. On most keyboards, the Windows key is located in the bottom left corner on the same row as the spacebar. Upon pressing this key combination, the screen may dim briefly to indicate that the screenshot was captured.

Copy the screenshot so you can paste it: Press the Print Screen key alone to copy the screen to your PC's clipboard. You can then paste the copied screenshot into a document, email message, or social media post by right-clicking the desired location and selecting Paste.
On some Windows laptops, you will need to hold down the Fn key as you press the Print Screen key. Find the screenshot. If you used Windows key + Print Screen to capture the screenshot, follow these steps to find the file: 

Open File Explorer by pressing Windows key + E on your keyboard.
If you see a folder called Pictures in the left panel, click it. If not, click This PC, and then double-click the Pictures folder.
Double-click the Screenshots folder.
Each screenshot that you take is labeled ""Screenshot (number)."" Depending on the version of Windows you're using, the file name will either end with a number that corresponds with the number of screenshots you've taken, or the date and time at which you captured the screenshot.
If you can't find your screenshot, try using the Snipping Tool instead. See Snipping Tool (Windows 11) or Snipping Tool (Windows 10 and earlier). Click the window that you want to capture. If you only want to screenshot a single window, click anywhere on the window you want to capture. Make sure the window is in front of all your other windows. Hold down Alt and press ⎙ PrtScr. This copies an image of the window to the clipboard.

You will not see any confirmation that the screenshot has been taken.
On some Windows keyboards, you will need to also hold down the Fn key when you use print screen. Open Paint. This program comes installed on all Windows computers. To open it:

Press Windows key + S to activate the search bar.
Type paint.
Click Paint. Press Ctrl+V to paste the screenshot. You will now see your one-window screenshot in the Paint window.

You can also paste the screenshot into other programs, such as Word or into the body of an email. Simply open the program that you want to paste the image into and press Ctrl + V.
Alternatively, you can paste the screenshot into any open document, email, or other area using this shortcut.
If your screenshot doesn't appear, try using the Snipping Tool instead. See Snipping Tool (Windows 11) or Snipping Tool (Windows 10 and earlier). Save your screenshot as an image. Click File, click Save, enter a file name, click a location on the left side of the page, and click Save.
You can change the screenshot's file type by clicking the ""Save as type"" drop-down box at the bottom of the window and then clicking a different format (e.g., JPEG) in the drop-down menu. Open the Snipping Tool. The Windows 11 Snipping Tool makes it incredibly easy to capture and edit full-screen and partial-screen screenshots.  To open the tool, click Search in the taskbar, type snip, and then click Snipping Tool. Select a screenshot mode. Click the Mode menu, which is the down-arrow at the top of the screen. Then, choose an option:


Rectangle mode: Let's you capture any part of the screen by drawing a rectangle around an area.

Window mode: Allows you to capture an individual window without getting anything else in the screenshot.

Full-screen mode: Captures everything on the screen.

Free-form mode: Lets you draw any shape around an area of the screen to take a screenshot. Click + New. It's at the top-right corner of Snipping Tool. Capture your screenshot.

In Rectangle mode, click and drag a rectangle around the desired area to instantly capture a screenshot.
In Window mode, click the window you want to capture to take the screenshot.
In Full-screen mode, the entire screen will instantly capture.
In Free-form mode, draw an outline around the part of the screen you want to capture. Click the Snipping Tool icon in the taskbar to view your screenshot. Now you'll see a preview of your screenshot, which gives you a chance to edit it if you'd like. Edit your screenshot (optional). If you'd like to crop the screenshot, click the crop tool at the bottom, then select the part of the screenshot you want to keep. You can also use the other editing tools at the bottom to draw on or erase part of the screenshot, which is helpful if you need to redact something. Save your screenshot. Now that you've taken a screenshot, you can save it easily:

Click the disk icon at the top.
Select a location to save your screenshot.
Name your file and click Save. Use the Snipping Tool shortcut in the future. Now that you know how to use Snipping Tool, you can use this handy shortcut next time you want to take a screenshot: Windows key + Shift + S.

When you use the keyboard shortcut, you'll see a smaller version of Snipping Tool at the top of the screen. Each icon on the Snipping Tool indicates a different screenshot type—Rectangle Mode, Window Mode, Full-screen Mode, and Free-form Mode.
Click the mode you'd like to use, then capture your screenshot. Open the Snipping Tool. The Snipping Tool is an great way to take all kinds of screenshots, including full-screen, individual windows, and even a particular area of the screen.

On Windows 10, press Windows key + S, type snip, and click Snipping tool.
On Windows 8.1, swipe in from the edge, select Search, type snipping, and then select Snipping Tool.
On Windows 7, click the Start menu, type snipping, and then click Snipping Tool. Choose the shape of the Snip. ""Rectangular Snip"" is chosen by default. Click the Arrow button next to the Mode button to change the Snip shape:.


Free-form Snip lets you draw any shape with your mouse. The area inside the shape will be snipped.

Rectangular Snip lets you select a rectangular area, which will be snipped.

Window Snip lets you choose a window to snip.

Full-screen Snip snips the whole screen, with all windows (except the Snipping Tool window) included. Create a new Snip. Click the New button to start the selection. The screen will fade, and you can draw your Snip area, or select the window if you chose Window Snip. Release the mouse to take your screenshot.
If you had Full-screen Snip selected, your Snip will automatically be created once you click New. Annotate the Snip (optional). Once you create the Snip, it will open in a new window. You can use the Pen tool to draw on it and make notes, and use the Highlight tool to draw attention to text.
The Erase tool will only erase annotations, not the screenshot itself. Save the Snip. Click the floppy disk icon to open the save dialog. Type in a name for the screenshot and change the ""Save as type:"" field if desired. You can now send the screenshot by email or put it on a website.
PNG is the default format in Windows 8 and later. The default format in earlier versions is JPG. Paste or save the Snip. By default, the Snip is copied to the clipboard when you create it. This means you can paste it into Paint or Word, much like you would with a full-screen screenshot. In Paint, you can make more edits than you can in the Snip annotation editor.
To paste the Snip, open a window that supports pasting and press Ctrl+V. Go to the view that you want to screenshot. Open the program or screen that you want to take a picture of, making sure that any windows or items that you don't want on-screen are out of the way. Press ⊞ Win+⇧ Shift+S. Doing so will cause your screen to turn grey, and your mouse will turn into a crosshairs icon. The Snipping Tool will open at the top of the screen.

By default, the shortcut will open Snipping Tool in Rectangle Snip Mode, which means you can click and drag a rectangle around the area of the screen you want to capture.
On Windows 10, you can select a different screenshot mode from the Mode menu. For example, if you want to capture the whole screen, select Full-screen Snip (which takes the screenshot automatically). To capture a single window, select Window Snip.
On Windows 11, you can select a different mode to take a screenshot using the icons at the top. . The icons in order are Rectangle Mode (the default), Window Mode, Full-screen Mode (which takes the screenshot automatically), and Free-form Mode. Select an area to screenshot. Click and drag your mouse from the top-left corner of the area that you want to screenshot to the bottom-right corner. When you release the mouse button, the screenshot will be captured, as well as copied to your clipboard.
If you selected a full-screen screenshot, you can skip this step. Paste or save your screenshot. You can now paste your screenshot into any program that allows pasting photos (e.g., Paint, Word, an email, etc.) by pressing Ctrl+V. You should see the section of the screen that you selected appear in your program.
Alternatively, save your screenshot as an image file by pressing Ctrl + S, entering a name, selecting a save location, and clicking Save. Open the Xbox Game Bar. The Game Bar is a handy tool that makes it easy to capture screenshots of games, as well as any other open windows on your PC. To open the tool, press Windows key + G at the same time.
You can even use the Xbox Game Bar to record your screen in real time. Click the Widget menu. It's the it's the second icon from the left in the Game Bar at the top of the screen. Click Capture. You'll see this near the top of the menu. The Capture widget will appear. Click the pushpin icon on the Capture widget. This pins the widget to your screen so it won't disappear when you navigate away. Click the window you want to capture. You can capture any single window on your screen, such as your web browser, a game, or a document. Click the camera icon on the Game Bar. This captures a screenshot of the activate window and saves it to your screenshots folder. Click See my captures to view your screenshots. You'll see this option at the bottom of the Capture widget. Here, you'll find all of the screenshots you've captured using the Game Bar.
When you're finished taking screenshots, follow these steps to unpin the Capture widget:

Press Windows key + G to reopen the Game Bar.
Click the pushpin icon.
Click anywhere on the screen. Press and hold the Windows logo. This is the logo on the bezel of the tablet, not the Windows button on your desktop.
If there is no Windows button on the tablet, press the Power button instead. Press the Volume Down button (or Volume Up if using the Power button). The screen will dim momentarily to indicate a screenshot was taken.
Your screenshot will be stored in the Screenshots folder, which you can access by Opening File Explorer and navigating to Pictures → Screenshots. Go to the initial screen that you want to screenshot. This should be the first page in the sequence of pages that you want to screenshot.

Understand how this works. The Windows Steps Recorder allows you to record up to 100 different screens and save them all to one document. This program also makes a note of where you click and which actions you perform on each screen. Press ⊞ Win+S. This activates the Windows search bar. Type psr.exe and press ↵ Enter. This opens the Windows Steps Recorder. Click Start Record. This is at the top of the toolbar. Doing so turns on the Steps Recorder, which will record the next 25 screen changes.
If you want to record more than 25 changes, first click Android dropdown button on the right side of the toolbar, click Settings..., and change the ""Number of recent screen captures to store"" number. Click through your different screens. Each time your screen changes (other than simply moving your mouse), the Steps Recorder will take a screenshot. Click Stop Record. It's at the top of the toolbar. Doing so stops recording screen changes and opens the results window. Review your screenshots. Scroll down through the window to make sure that you captured all of the screenshots that you wanted to save. Save your screenshots to a ZIP folder. Click Save at the top of the window, enter a file name and select a save location, and click Save.
This will save the screenshots in one HTML file. You can open the HTML file in your browser in order to view its contents."
How to Play Poker,"Learn the 10 basic 5-card hands and their ranking. No matter what type of poker you play, the hands will always be the same. To start familiarizing yourself with the different hands, print out a ""cheat sheet"" and study it. Then, memorize the different hands so you can easily recognize them. Here are the winning poker hands, from highest to lowest:

The highest-ranking hand is a royal flush (the royal straight flush). This hand includes a 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of the same suit, one kind (all clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades). It can only be tied but not beaten by the royal flush of another suit.
A straight flush is made up of 5 consecutive cards of the same suit.

4 of a kind means you have 4 cards of the same rank (but different suits, of course) and a fifth card of any rank (such as 4 aces and a 9). If you have 4 aces, then no one can have any hand with an ace, so no royal flush is available.
A full house contains 3 matching cards of 1 rank and 2 matching cards of another rank.
A flush contains any 5 cards of the same suit. These skip around in rank or sequence, but are from the same suit.
A straight contains 5 cards of consecutive rank but from more than one suit.

3 of a kind means you have 3 cards of the same rank, plus two unmatched cards.

2 pair is made up of two cards of one rank, plus two cards of another rank (different from the first pair), plus one unmatched card.

Pair means you have 2 cards of the same rank, plus 3 other unmatched cards.

High card is the lowest-ranking (called a ""nothing"") hand, when no two cards have the same rank, the five cards are not consecutive, and they are not all from the same suit. Place the blinds (starting bets) or ""ante up."" In poker, bets are placed at the beginning of the game in one of 2 ways. In Texas Hold’em, the player next to the dealer typically places a small blind bet that’s half of the usual minimum bet, while the player to that person’s left places a big blind that’s at least the minimum bet. As another option, each player can “ante up” the minimum starting bet, which means placing a minimum starting bet into the pool.
Aside from Texas Hold’em, most poker variants use an “ante up” system. Look at the 2 cards the dealer gives you, which is your hand. The dealer will ""burn"" the first card on the deck, which means placing it out of play. Then, they'll pass out 2 cards to each player. Check your cards to see what you're holding.

In poker, the dealer will burn a card every round of dealing. That way, it’s harder for players to anticipate what card is coming up and the game becomes more of a gamble.
The dealer will always pass out the cards in a clockwise direction, starting on the left. Bet, call or raise after each round is dealt if you want to. Every time the dealer puts out new cards, you'll make a bet, with the first bet being made solely based on the two cards the players have in their hands. Betting happens in a circle – when it's your turn to bet, you have a few options. At this point you can:

Place an initial bet if no one else has yet.
Say ""check"" to avoid betting.
Say ""call"" to match the bet someone else has made.
Say ""raise"" to add more money to the betting pool. If you ""raise,"" the other players will go around in a circle and choose to either ""call"" your new bet or fold.
Say ""fold"" if someone else has bet and you don't want to match their bet. If you fold, turn your cards into the dealer face-down to avoid giving the other players any advantages! Look at the “flop” to see if you have a good hand. After the first round of betting, the dealer will ""burn"" the top card on the deck. Then, they'll put 3 cards face-up on the table, which is called the ""flop."" These are the community cards that every player can use to build their hand. Compare these cards and the cards in your hand, then place a bet, call a bet, or fold.

In total, the dealer will reveal 5 cards. You will have 7 cards total to use to create your best hand of 5: your two personal cards in your hands, and the five community cards on the table. While your luck can turn later on in a game, take some time to analyze the table after the ""flop"" – are you well-positioned to end the game with a good hand?
Depending on the rules where you’re playing, you can also draw replacement cards for the cards in your hand. This is usually done during or just after the betting round. Check the “turn” card after the second round of betting. The dealer will ""burn"" the top card, then they'll place 1 card face up next to the flop. This is called the “turn” card or the “fourth street” card. Check all of the cards on the table and the cards in your hand to see if you want to bet, call, or raise.

Your game may also allow a card exchange at this point, but this isn’t typical in professional games.
As you look at the cards, think about the possible hands other players might have. For instance, if all 4 cards on the table are spades, then any player who has a spade in their hand will have a flush, which means they have 5 cards from the same house.
Similarly, if the cards on the table are 5,6,7, and 8, then anyone with a 4 or 9 will have a straight.
If you have nothing good in your hand but the cards on the table make for an easy winning hand, then you may want to fold, as it’s likely another player has a winning card. Examine the ""river"" card and decide on the hand you'll play. After the dealer ""burns"" the top card on the deck, they'll put 1 last card face up next to the “turn” card. This final card is called the “river.” Check your hand and the community cards to decide on your best 5-card hand. Then, bet, call, or fold.
If the rules allow it, you may be able to exchange your hand 1 final time before or after betting. However, this isn’t common in professional games. Reveal each player’s hand clockwise in the final “showdown.” After each player calls, folds, or bets in the last round, each remaining player will participate in the “showdown.” Starting to the left of the dealer, all players involved will reveal their cards face up. Then, everyone looks at the turned over hands to see who has the highest value hand to win the entire pot.

If there is a tie, the tied players split the pot.
If you fold your hand, then you don’t have to show your cards.
In Texas Hold’em, there are 5 cards on the table and 2 cards in your hand. You can create any 5-card combination using these 7 cards. The remaining cards aren’t counted.
If you want to play the cards on the table only, this is called “playing the board.” However, it’s an option that everyone has, so it may not be the best strategy. Guesstimate the risks on your starting hand. Look at your cards to see what you’re holding. Check for a pair, 2 consecutive numbers, cards that are from the same house, or face cards, which may be good cards. Then, decide if it’s worth placing a bet to see what the community cards will be.

You should almost always raise when your hand is a pair, face cards, or aces. An ace and a king or an ace and a queen are strong hands as well. If you have these hands, bet before the flop to raise the value of the pot.
If the card you need doesn’t turn up, you can either bluff or fold. Sometimes, with good bluffing skills and some luck, a bad hand can win the whole game. Start the bidding with the player to the left of the big blind or dealer. In the first round, bidding starts to the left of the big blind. In later rounds, the bidding starts to the left of the dealer. From there, the bidding goes clockwise.
If you’re playing a game with an ante instead of a blind, always start betting with the player to the left of the dealer. Call the bet if you want to stay in but don’t have great cards. This means you want to stay in the game but don’t want to raise the bet. When you call, match the bet of the person before you by adding your chips or money to the pot. Your turn is now over.

If the flop comes and you’re holding a hand that doesn’t play, check and fold. You don’t want to keep betting money at a hand that won’t win.
If the flop comes and you have a strong hand, bet at it. This will force weaker hands out and raise the value of your pot. Raise the bet if you have a good hand. When the bet comes to you, tell the other players you want to raise. Then, say how much you are betting and place your money or chips into the pot. This ends your turn.

Say, “I raise the bet to $30.”
You can’t raise the bet above the maximum for your game. Fold if the current bet is too high or you have a bad hand. This means quitting the round of poker. To fold, place your cards face down on the table and say, “I fold.” Then, add your cards to the discard pile.

Don’t show your cards when you fold during a game, as this can spoil which cards are out of play. That may give certain players an upper hand.
The key to being successful at poker is knowing when to fold your hand and accept a smaller loss or when to hold onto it and risk a larger loss for a chance to win the pot. Decide if you want to draw any cards (if the game allows it). Look at your cards and decide if you want to play this hand. If you’d like to try for better cards, discard the cards you don’t want. Then, draw replacement cards from the draw pile at the center of the table. 

You can discard as many cards as you’d like.
You may not be allowed to draw new cards when playing Texas Hold’em, so check the rules for your game before you start playing. Play only with money you’re willing to lose. When you are learning, you should never gamble more than you would consider acceptable to lose. During the game, don’t add to your bankroll or dive back in after losing everything you planned to gamble. Wait until you’re comfortable losing that amount again before you play another game.

The general rule of thumb is you should be able to easily afford to lose 200 bets at the highest limit. So if the limit is $5 bets, then your bankroll should be $1000, and stop there.
Track your wins and losses if you start getting more serious about poker. This will help you figure out whether you are winning or losing in the long run.
Remember that you must keep records and pay taxes on your gambling income to avoid legal trouble. Learn to read basic tells. Playing your opponents is arguably even more important than playing your cards in poker. This is a more advanced aspect of the game, but it’s always good to be aware of players’ tells—especially your own. Watch for betting patterns such as betting early, very often (probably with weak hands), or late in a hand (as intimidation). Physical tells can also give you an estimation of your opponent’s strength of hand and help you keep your own strategy secret by avoiding such patterns.

Some classic tells include shallow breathing, sighing, nostrils flaring, flushing red, eyes watering, blinking, swallowing excessively, or an increasing pulse seen in the neck or temple.
A hand over the mouth is usually to conceal a smile, while shaking hands usually reveal nerves.
If a player glances at their chips when the flop comes, they probably have a strong hand.
If a mediocre player tries to impress you by staring you down, they are likely bluffing. Identify conservative players from aggressive players. This will help you determine players' betting patterns and read them more easily. You can tell if players are more conservative by noticing those folding early—evidently only staying in a hand when their cards are good.

Very conservative players won’t lose as much money, but they're easily spotted by more experienced players. Because they tend to avoid high betting, they can often be bluffed into folding.
Aggressive players are risk-takers that often bet high early in a hand before seeing how the other players are acting on their cards. Practice and watch others play to develop quick instincts. The more you play and watch, the faster and better you’ll get. Since every poker game is different, it’s important to develop good instincts rather than try to memorize and apply tricky systems. Observe experienced players and imagine how you’d react in their position. Then, watch how the experienced players react to build your own instincts.
While you do this, consider how successful you’d have been if you were playing and reacted as you did. Would you have won, or would you have lost? Then, decide how you can improve your strategy going forward. Shuffle the cards and cut the deck before they’re dealt. Shuffling the cards mixes them up to make the game fairer. To do a basic shuffle, split the deck into 2 stacks. Next, hold a stack in each hand close together and facing each other. Use your thumbs to flip through the cards, combining the deck into one. After the cards are shuffled, get someone who isn’t the dealer to cut the deck by separating it into 2 stacks and placing the bottom stack on top.

Do several shuffles to make sure the cards are mixed up.
You can cut the deck more than once if you’d like.
The dealer typically does the shuffling and bets last, which is called the “button” position. After each hand, you’ll pass the dealer/button position to the next player on the left. If the dealer is always the same person, like in a casino, the button position will still pass clockwise around the table. Say “check"" to skip placing a bet or simply tap the table twice with two fingers. You can say this if you are the first better or if all those already betting have checked. If you say ""check"" when it's your turn at the beginning of a new hand, that means you are choosing not to place a bet at that point. Instead, you pass the chance to open to the next player.

In the following rounds, if you say “check,” that means you’re staying with the bets you already paid into the pot during this hand, and you won’t pay more until someone else raises during their turn.
If another player does raise on that hand, then you nor anyone else can say ""check"" or maintain your “check”—so when the play comes around to you again you have to either match or raise the latest bet or fold your hand. Say ""I open"" if a bet hasn’t been placed yet and you want to open too betting. For example, you could raise the ante $1 or at least the agreed minimum raise. If you choose not to open, take turns in clockwise order, until someone else has opened or every player checked. If everyone checks, then it is time to choose to discard and draw 1 to 3 cards, or ""hold pat"" on the cards you have. When there are fewer than 3 cards available to draw, replacements will be drawn.
The dealer will have to shuffle the discards and add them to the bottom of the draw stack. Say “call” if you want to bet the same as the last person. Calling means making a bet equal to the last bet or raise. For example, if the person right of you just bet $10 and it's now your turn, you would say ""call"" or “I call” to match that bet. Then you would place $10 in chips or cash in the pot. “Raise” to increase the current betting amount. This is also known as “sweetening the pot.” Raise or re-raise requires finishing this round and making another round to now allow any others to ""call"" or ""raise"" the amount of that last bet to stay in the game, or else ""fold"". The ones who already called can check on this turn and the hand is finished unless someone re-raises.

If someone before you bets $20 and you think you have a winning hand or you want to bluff, you can raise when it's your turn by saying “raise to $30.”
However, do not say “I see your 20, and I’ll raise you 10…” Despite being popular in movies, this is actually frowned upon as sloppy table talk. Say “I fold” when you're ready to quit a hand. Folding means forfeiting your cards and giving up that pot with any bets you've made into it. Wait to be dealt into the next hand if you have chips or have not reached your limit of losses. To fold when it’s your turn, put your cards face down on the table and place them onto the discard pile.
You can fold at any point in a hand when it’s your turn. “Cash-in” when you’re ready to quit the game. This means exchanging your poker chips for money. If you still have chips but don’t want to play anymore, take your chips to the bank and tell them you’re ready to cash in. The bank will determine how much money your chips represent, then they’ll hand you cash.
You can usually return and watch the game after you cash in. Master the basics of five-card draw. This variation has optional rules that can be agreed on before the game begins, such as whether or not to use jokers and wildcards, or which cards are high and low. The object of the game is similar to Texas Hold ‘Em: to get the best 5-card hand, but within the bounds of your own 5-card hand, without common cards.

Determine the betting structure by deciding if you’ll play fixed-limit, pot-limit, or no-limit.

Decide on the dealer by asking ""Who deals first?"". Depending on the group you’re with and where you’re playing, a dealer may be elected or each player could draw for the position. The organizer or host may also choose to deal first. Learn 3-card draw. In this game, the players start by making an ante bet. The dealer and each of the players then get 3 cards, and the players must decide whether to make a play bet or fold. Finally, the dealer reveals their cards for a showdown and whoever has the best hand wins.
Like with a 5-card draw, you can choose to vary the rules if you’re playing at home. For instance, jokers can be wild, meaning they can be used to represent any card value. Study some of the more obscure variations. If you really get into the game or just want to impress others with your knowledge of poker, learn the rules of the other variations. These include Straight Poker, 5-Card Stud, 7-Card Stud, Lowball, Omaha, Pineapple, Crazy Pineapple, Cincinnati, and Dr. Pepper.

How to French Kiss,"Keep your lips soft. A soft, smooth, and slightly moist mouth is ideal for kissing. Before you move in, you should make sure your lips aren't chapped or dry so your partner isn't distracted or put off by the state of your lips. If you want to soften your lips before you go in for the kiss, you should try these quick fixes:

Use chapstick. Swipe some over your lips and press them together. (If you're a girl and you have flavored chapstick, all the better!) The only caveat is that you should apply lip balm or gloss an hour or more before you kiss, so your kissing partner feels your soft lips, not the thick layer of gloss over them.
Drink water. Dry lips are a sign of dehydration, so throw back a tall glass of water (or two). You should notice your lips starting to smooth out within 20 to 30 minutes.
Lick your lips. If you're really in a pinch and have no time to spare, quickly run your tongue over your lips and press them together. This should moisten them slightly without making them slobbery or slick. You can even lick your lips a bit subtly while making eye contact with your kissing partner. Freshen your breath. You never want to have bad breath when you are about to kiss someone, whether the kiss is a French kiss or not. Because your mouth will be open in a French kiss, fresh breath is especially important. Practice good dental hygiene. If you know you are about to kiss someone, take a second to brush your teeth or at least rinse out your mouth with water.

Always have breath mints or mint-flavored gum with you if you think there is a chance you might kiss someone while you are out. If you want to be subtle, you can quickly suck on a breath mint or chew gum for a minute in the bathroom, so you don't make it too obvious that you're ready to kiss.
Avoid foods that leave an unpleasant aftertaste or residue, particularly garlic, coffee, onions, milk, and corn. If you're on a dinner date before the big kiss, try to eat strategically. Find the right moment. A good kiss—especially a first kiss or first French kiss—is the culmination of building tension and growing intimacy. Choose your moment right to make sure you and your partner are both in a mindset to really lose yourselves in the kiss. You should have privacy and should both be feeling romantic instead of stressed or distracted, for one thing. When is the moment right? It depends on your individual situation, but here are a few signs to keep in mind:

You have complete privacy. Whether you're alone on your balcony or sitting on a secluded bench in a park, you're not worried that someone will interrupt you.
The other person keeps dropping hints, like locking eyes and looking at your lips, or standing or sitting progressively closer to you. Regardless of your partner's gender, their body language should give you a clue about whether now is the right time to make your move.

You're ending a date that went really well. In the car or on the porch are both good semi-private locations for a goodnight kiss.
It just seems right. If you feel overwhelmingly compelled to kiss someone, don't be too afraid to just go for it. (Just be prepared for an awkward or even troubling situation if you discover your intended didn't feel the same way.)

Ask. If you aren't sure whether the other person is feeling it, bring up the topic. Better to get permission semi-awkwardly and go ahead with confidence than risk missing out on your chance to kiss that special someone (accidentally kiss someone who isn't interested). Make eye contact. Gaze deeply into the other person's eyes. If you want to make your intentions extra clear, slowly move your gaze to their lips, then back up to the eyes. You can even make intense eye contact, break it for a few seconds, and then look back at the person. This is a way of showing the person you want to kiss that you're pleasantly overwhelmed at the sight of them.
Girls can even look at a guy, look down, and then look up through their lashes to be extra flirtatious. Smile. If you're really excited about the prospect of kissing the other person, show it! A smile keeps the situation light and fun, while helping them feel safe and relaxed. Make sure your smile is soft and genuine, however, and not a forced, too-wide, or overly intense smile. Just slowly and languidly ease your lips into a smile. Show your future kissing partner how happy you are to be in their company. Continue to make eye contact as you do this, or break it for a few seconds before you return it.
You can opt for a close-lipped smile instead of smiling while showing your teeth, which might come off more as friendly than alluring or romantic. Break the touch barrier. Once you're alone with the person you like and you're smiling and making eye contact, you can decide if you want to go in for the kiss without touching, or if you want to break the touch barrier first. This can mean sitting with your legs touching, holding hands, putting your hand on the person's knee, stroking the person's arm, or just giving a sign of affection. If you've kissed the person on the lips before, then breaking the touch barrier may feel more natural for you, and you should make an effort to touch the person before you touch lips so both of you feel more at ease.
You can also break the touch barrier as you're moving in to kiss the person. If you're standing, you can touch the person's arms, neck, or shoulders as you move in for the kiss. If you're sitting, you can put a hand on the person's back. Move in. When the moment seems right, go in for the approach. In general, you should be moving slowly enough that the other person has time to  say no, but not so slow that the moment loses its spark. When you start to get the feeling that your kissing partner is ready for the next step, you shouldn't dilly-dally. Move your body toward their body until your heads are just a few inches apart. That's when you'll have to start angling your head for the best kissing position.
Take it slow. The slow approach builds tension and anticipation. Move in at a pace that gives the other person a chance to consent (or not). When they see you coming in, they may move to meet you, so going slow will prevent you from accidentally bumping heads. Tilt your head slightly to one side. Meeting head-on will result in bumping noses. Instead, just tilt your head slightly to the left or right. If you notice the other person going in one direction, pick the opposite. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to do this perfectly. If you and your partner end up kissing each other head-on and bumping noses a bit, then you'll naturally adjust your heads into a more comfortable position, where your noses aren't in the way.
Unlike what you may think from the movies, this doesn't have to happen in slow motion. You'll tilt your head as you move closer to the person, not at a snail's pace, so you don't have to worry about having the time to get it perfect. Close your eyes. Just before you make contact, close your eyes. Kissing with your eyes open is generally associated with dishonesty and insincerity, and keeping your eyes closed will help you focus on and enjoy what's happening on your lips. Also, while you may be tempted to open your eyes to see what your kissing partner looks like in the throes of passion, this could actually unexpectedly make you crack up or not feel in the mood to kiss anymore. Closing your eyes can also help you focus on your mouth and to live in the moment, instead of trying to observe everything that's happening at close range.
You can slowly open your eyes later, when you pull apart after the kiss. Keep your mouth in a kissable position. Don't present a stiff pucker, like you would if you went in to kiss your grandma — not only does it communicate non-romantic feelings, but it makes it physically difficult for your partner to initiate a French kiss. On the other hand, keeping your mouth completely loose and still also says that you're not interested. Here's how to hit a happy medium:


Pucker just a little. Push your lips forward slightly, so that you feel the slightest hint of muscle tension around them.
Open your mouth slightly. Instead of aggressively going in for a fully open-mouthed kiss at first, keep your lips just barely parted enough that a tongue could slip between them. Lightly brush your lips over the other person's. Use feather-light pressure at first, so that your lips are just barely grazing over your partner's. This builds more anticipation and excitement than diving straight into a full-on French kiss. This also signals to your partner that you may be wanting more without being too forward about it.
Keep your movements slow. A lot of quick, light kisses don't have the same level of sexiness as a barely-restrained build in tension. Act like you have all the time in the world—the kiss will speed up soon enough. Test the waters. Once you've built a solid foundation for a French kiss with some tongueless kissing, you can give the other person some subtle hints that you're ready to kick it up a notch. In general, if it's your first time kissing the person, you should be a bit cautious before initiating a French kiss, because this may come off as too much too soon. But beyond that, here are some things to keep in mind as you test the waters to signal that you're ready to kiss with your tongue:

Open your mouth more widely. Offering unrestricted access invites the other person to make the first tentative tongue contact.
Lock lips, so that the other person's lower lip is between your two lips. Then, lightly sweep the tip of your tongue over the lower lip. Do one smooth, swift motion so that the contact lasts for less than a second. If they are interested, they'll reciprocate.

Know when to pull back. If you've tried both of the above techniques and your partner hasn't responded, simply leave it alone until next time and focus on regular kissing. Avoid making a big deal of it, or guilting them. Explore with your tongue. If the other person seems interested, go ahead and start French kissing for real. Remember to keep your tongue in motion and your touches light. First, just slowly slide your tongue into your partner's mouth. You can either begin by placing it above or below your partner's tongue, or even move it around the tongue a bit if you're feeling bold. Just make sure your partner's tongue is reciprocating your actions so you're not just kissing a limp tongue, or the romance will dissipate pretty quickly. Here are some things to keep in mind as you explore the French kiss:


Stay playful. ""Tag"" the other person's tongue lightly and retreat back, inviting them to make the next move.
Tongues are loaded with nerve endings, and the mere act of touching your partner's tongue with your own will be very pleasant.

Don't go too deep — jamming your tongue down the other person's throat is a big turn-off. Stay shallow and light at first. See how far your partner wants to go, and follow suit. Breathe. If you’re kissing for an extended period, it’s easy to forget to breathe. Believe it or not, gasping and turning blue isn't very romantic. You may think that a truly passionate kiss involves many minutes of non-stop kisses, but if you really want to up the romance factor, then you have to stay alert and conscious. Once you fall into a rhythm, you should be able to find a suitable pattern for breathing without interrupting the flow of your kisses. Here's what you need to know:

Take small breaths through your nose as you kiss.
Don't be afraid to take a break. If you do it right, it can still be an intimate and sexy moment. Pull back slightly so that your foreheads are still touching, make eye contact, and smile.
As you and your partner grow comfortable with the kiss, you can try breathing through your mouth a little: sharing breaths as well can be romantic (but not everybody likes it). Mix it up. Kisses are like snowflakes: no two are exactly the same. Once you feel comfortable French kissing someone, it is tempting to try to do the same thing every time, but you should resist if you want to keep things interesting. You should be able to fall into a nice, comfortable rhythm while adding enough variety from time to time to keep things interesting. Here's what you can vary:

Speed: Varying the speed of your kisses is a good way to try something different without potentially intimidating your partner. Once you've got the slow kiss mastered, try going a little faster for a few seconds — it should leave you both a little breathless!
Depth: Once you're comfortable with someone, try kissing a little more deeply.  The key to pulling this off is keeping your speed under control. Or, if you want things to be a little more flirty and playful, return to shallow kisses.
Pressure: Like a deep kiss, a hard kiss should be reserved for a situation in which you already know both you and your partner are comfortable. Be a little bit more forceful with your tongue, but be sure to keep it in motion.

Teeth: You may want to try rubbing the backs or front of the other person's teeth with your tongue. This can create a ticklish feeling that might enhance your kiss. You could also try lightly catching the other person's lower lip with your teeth. Be aware, though, that not everyone likes their kisses with a side of teeth — be prepared to put your chompers away. Use your hands. While you should keep your hands polite, especially on a first kiss, you don’t necessarily want them just dangling at your sides. Using your hands and touching your partner's body (while keeping it respectful) can enhance the romantic feeling of the kiss and can make you and your kissing partner feel more connected. Once you make contact with your partner's body, you can move your hands around gently from time to time without being frantic about it. Here's what you need to know about using your hands while you French kiss:

As a general rule, start with your hands on your partner's hips and then slowly move them around their back or up to the face and hair.
Another turn-on for the first kiss is to gently caress the other person's shoulder. It shows you are comfortable with them.
Cradle your partner's face with your hands on their cheeks and their neck.
Or, go for an old standby: simply wrap your arms around your partner in an embrace. Read your partner's body language. Everybody kisses a little differently, and each person enjoys different things in a kiss — there is no ""right"" way to kiss. Good kissing requires give-and-take, so read your partner’s body language and pay attention to clues that tell you you’re doing something they like. The most important thing is to make sure that your kissing partner is comfortable with the pace of your kissing and affectionate gestures.

Not everybody likes to be kissed the same way, so while your former partner might have enjoyed one method of kissing, your new love might not. You need to learn to read signals and adapt to a style that's comfortable for each of you.
If your partner pulls away or seems uncomfortable at any time, understand that you have to slow it down.
Let your partner kiss you back and move with them as long as you’re comfortable with what they are doing.

Listen for clues that tell how much your partner is enjoying a particular maneuver. If you hear a sigh or moan, or they begin kissing you back with increased intensity, you're on the right track. Practice. Good French kissing, like good kissing of any kind, requires practice. You will get better as you do it more. In addition, the more practice you have with one person, the more comfortable you will feel kissing them and developing a style that suits both of you. Just because you may not have had a stellar first kiss doesn't mean that you and your kissing partner are romantically doomed; have patience and keep kissing slowly and gently until you fall into a rhythm that works for you.

Don't take yourselves too seriously, either. If you tried something that just plain failed, it's okay to laugh, to lightly apologize, and to try again. If you act devastated after a disappointing kiss, you'll only be making things weird for your partner, and there's no need for that.
Most first kisses, like most first attempts at love-making, aren't anything to write home about. Part of the fun is getting better at it — together. Communicate. If you really like the way your partner kisses you, let them know. If you don't like something, also let your partner know that, but approach it delicately and compliment them at the same time on something they did that you liked. If your partner is being honest and open with you, try not to overreact or get hurt, or this may make your partner feel hesitant to communicate with you in the future.

Even if the kiss goes all wrong, it can still be an intimate affair if you can both laugh about it together! The important thing is that you're both honest about how you're feeling and what you want to do to improve.
You should also communicate by telling your partner how attractive they look, and how much you like them. Make it clear how happy you are to be with the person you're with and the French kissing will come all the more naturally.
